<h2>WHAT IS BALLON D'OR?</h2>

<p>
The Ballon d'Or is an annual football award presented by France Football. It has been awarded since 1956. The Ballon d'Or award honours the best player over the previous year. It is based on football journalists votes.

<h2>MESSI AND ONLY MESSI</h2>

<p>
Messi started winning the award 2009. He won it 4 years in a row till 2012. Then he won it again 2015. This year he has won the sixth and is now the player with most Ballon D'Ors in history. However, we claim that if this award is given to the best player of the year, Messi should have won 5 more Ballon D'Or (2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018; all won by Cristiano). Messi is the best player in history and has proven that year after year. That's why we created this movement. We want France Football and FIFA to reconsider the last 5 Ballon D'Ors Cristiano Ronaldo recieved.</p>
